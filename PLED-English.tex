	\section{Preparation on the course plan}
	
	Several courses will have changes in the course plan, check the attached Excel file to
	find out changes, per institution.\\

	Many courses do not list the literature in the course plan, despite being a requirement.
	The Program Board has been made aware of this and will work on fixing that issue.\\

	The Program Board wants to exchange course EITA50 Signal Processing in Multimedia
	with a Machine Learning course, due to the bad experience of students with said course.\\

	\section{Other Information}
	Courses on Advanced level have a requirement of minimum 90 HP towards admittance, but it is not
	stated on all A-level courses, it will be considered what is the best way to inform about it.\\\newline
	For the Study Council, day as above,\\
