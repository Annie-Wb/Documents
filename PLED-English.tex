	\subsection{Courses}
	EDAP25 Distributed Systems is periodized but it hasn't been given in two years. The reason is issues with hiring a new teacher.\newline
	EDAN01 Contrstraint Programming is discontinued for the same reason. Nothing PLED can do about it because it is LTH's hiring process that is bad.\newline
	EDAA45 Programming, Basic Course and EDAA60 Computers and Computer Use are merged into a single 10.5HP course. Proposal has been sent to the department to keep EDAA60 as a course code in case it is needed for those admitted to the later part.\newline
	EITA65 Digitization is discontinued and replaced with a 12HP course with the same content except what was in EDAA60.\newline
	Everything else is approved, see previous minutes.
	
	\subsection{Modules}
	EITA55 Communication system changes distribution of HP applicable modules.\newline
	MAMF50 Usability evaluation compiles two modules.\newline
	MAMN25 Interaction Design has a new module with redistributed HP to the modules.
	
	\subsection{Updates}
	
	EDAA75 and EDAA40 Discrete Structures have a new course coordinator Susanna Rezende who is now responsible for the Discrete Structures course. It was proposed to combine the two courses into a single 7.5HP course to make the work situation better for the teacher.\newline
	Evaluation of the Education has happened. Representatives from Chalmers, KTH and MittUniversitet have talked to students about how education is now, the culture and what to improve.\newline
	The program management will check over the problems in the correction of EDAN40 Functional Programming exams.\newline
	Next meeting is on November 28th for Curriculum and Timetable.\newline
	PLED wants to have lunch with SRD to talk about anything we wish.\newline	
	SRD can ask the course coordinator to have a CEQ meeting even if there is no year representative or course representative, taking into account courses in Year 4 and 5 and courses with problems such as Discrete Structures and Functional Programming.\newline
	PLED intends to move MSc in Computer Engineering more towards software like InfoCom is, wants input from SRD. They suggested Databases, Operating Systems and/or AI in the basic block.
	Mikolaj suggested a workshop for students to know more about specializations in connection with lunch. Probably in February.\newline
	It was proposed to have a survey about the courses in the basic block: What is missing, what do you want to remove. Courses required by LTH and the Higher Education Ordinance cannot be removed and it should be specified.\newline
	PLED agrees that it would be possible for SRD to have a short presentation about course representatives before each course, especially year 4 and 5.
	PLED will have internal elections and can be replaced next year in June-August.
